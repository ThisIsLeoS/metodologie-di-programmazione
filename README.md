Midterm project and final project of the "Metodologie di Programmazione" course (Sapienza University of Rome - 2018/2019).

The objective of this course is to provide the fundamental concepts of the object oriented paradigm (classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, static and dinamic binding, collections, generics, design patterns, etc.).
The language used is Java.

You can find the projects specifications (in Italian) in the designated folders.

For the final project I did the front-end part.
